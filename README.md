Key features of the Tic-Tac-Toe (2 Players and vs Computer) project:

Two Exciting Game Modes:

vs Computer Mode: Test your skills against an AI opponent as Player 1 ('X') while the Computer takes on the role of Player 2 ('O').

2.Interactive Game Board:
The game board is displayed on the web page, allowing players to click on cells to make their moves.

In "2 Players" mode, the instructions indicate that Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'.
In "vs Computer" mode, it is mentioned that Player 1 is 'X' and the Computer is 'O'.

4.Game Outcome Notifications:
Informative messages are displayed when the game concludes, including messages for wins, ties, and game restart options.

5.Randomized Computer Moves:
